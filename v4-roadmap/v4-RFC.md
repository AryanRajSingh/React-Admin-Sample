# RFC for refine v4

We've released our roadmap for v4 and we're going to start working on it. Our aim is to deliver this version in the next month (Feb 2023). We will try to keep things non-breaking and provide a codemod to migrate from v3 to v4. This release will include some major changes in our API to make it more flexible and easier to use.

Our current list of tasks/features are listed below. We're going to update this list as we go. If you have any suggestions or questions, please feel free to comment here or reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/refine).
