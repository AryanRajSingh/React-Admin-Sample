# Our Motivation Behind V4

After moving to headless and and making our core flexible, we started seeing more opportunities to improve the flexibility and also release new features along the way, some of them were breaking changes, some were not but we want to do a major release to make our core and other packages more flexible in both our side to deliver new features and also for our users to easily adapt to new features and write more understandable code.

With version 4, we'll do our best to not introduce any breaking changes and this is one of our main goals for this release. There will be no breaking changes for the existing apps and version 4 will serve as a transition release for our users to adapt to the new features and changes. We'll also try to make the migration process as easy as possible for our users by providing a migration guides and a codemod script.

We have two main goals with this major release, one is to make refine more flexible and responsive to different needs and the other is to make it easier to use and start using refine both with existing projects and new projects. 

We're also trying to have a more consistent and predictable API for our users to use and understand. We hope this is not just going to improve developer experience while using refine but also improve the experience for creating new features and customizing refine.
