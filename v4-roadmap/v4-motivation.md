# Our Motivation Behind V4

After moving to headless and and making our core flexible, we started seeing more opportunities to improve the flexibility and also release new features along the way, some of them were breaking changes, some were not but we want to do a major release to make our core and other packages more flexible in both our side to deliver new features and also for our users to easily adapt to new features and write more understandable code.

We have two main goals with this major release, one is to make refine more flexible and responsive to different needs and the other is to make it easier to use and start using refine both with existing projects and new projects. 

We're also trying to have a more consistent and predictable API for our users to use and understand. We hope this is not just going to improve developer experience while using refine but also improve the experience for creating new features and customizing refine.
